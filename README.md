# Deploy Queue
Look! It's a deploy queue for Hubot!

Continuous deploymenting? Not sure if there is a deploy happening _right now_? Use this deploy queue to keep track.

## Commands
`deploy me`: Add yourself to the deploy queue. Hubot give you a heads up when it's your turn

`deploy done`: Say this when you're done and then Hubot will tell the next person. Or you could say `deploy complete` or `deploy donzo`.

`deploy forget me`: Removes you from the queue. If your on there more than once, then just remove your next turn. If your on there more than once, you might think about slowing down and deploying a litle less continuously. Or you could say `deploy forget it` or `deploy nevermind`

`deploy next`: Sneak peek at the next person in line. Do this if the anticipation is killing you. Also works with `deploy who's next` and `deploy who's on first`.
